# GameBanana Likes Graph

A serverless API that generates a star-history style graph for GameBanana submissions showing likes over time.

**Inspired by [star-history](https://github.com/star-history/star-history)**

## Usage

Embed the graph in your mods description by replacing `{SECTION}` and `{ID}` with your GameBanana submission details:

If you have a lot of likes (500+) it might time-out initially, just refresh.

```html
<img src="https://gamebanana-likes.vercel.app/api/graph?section={SECTION}&id={ID}" alt="Likes Graph">
```

## Parameters

- `section` **(required)**: GameBanana section type (e.g., `tool`, `mod`, `script`, `sound`, `spray`, `wip`). Case-insensitive and automatically de-pluralized, so `tools`, `Tools`, or `TOOLS` all work.
- `id` **(required)**: Your submission ID (find it in your GameBanana URL)
- `theme` *(optional)*: `light`, `dark`, or `trans` (transparent). Defaults to `trans`.

## Notes

- The graph caches for 1 hour
- Supports up to 12,500 likes (250 pages)

## How it works

1. Fetches submission details from GameBanana API
2. Fetches all likes with pagination from GameBanana API
3. Extracts the `_tsDateAdded` timestamp from each like
4. Groups likes by date and creates cumulative counts

### Design Attribution

This project uses design elements adapted from [star-history](https://github.com/star-history/star-history) under the MIT License:
- xkcdify SVG filter for sketch effect
- Color palettes for light/dark themes
- Number formatting approach
- Typography and layout


## Markdown Example

For Casual Preloader (Tools #19049):
